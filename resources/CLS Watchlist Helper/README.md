CLS Watchlist Helper

Experimental project adding a button on IMDB page to quick-add the currently
browsed movie to the CLS Watchlist. This requires a CLS API, which does not
exist at this stage sadly... work in progress.

TODO: on hover, dropdown some more icons to add to watched
TODO: on page load, query whether the film is already on the watch- or watched list
TODO: store the user login / apikey (autoload when visiting CLS profile page?)
